A growing library of example tests for use with your Sauce Labs (saucelabs.com) cross-browser testing account.

This is an ongoing project. As the list grows, I'll be adding categories and an index (in the wiki). I don't guarantee that scripts are up to date, but they all successfully pass at the time of publishing.

Feel free to submit examples to alex@saucelabs.com; any submissions will be stripped of identifying information and tested out before publishing.
